# excalidraw-electron
A simple Electron wrapper for Excalidraw.

All credit goes to [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw), this is just an Electron wrapper for it.

It currently uses a pre-release version of Excalidraw that has better integrated stylus support but may be less stable, once that version transitions from the **next** release channel to **latest**, this is gonna settle on a stabler release channel.
